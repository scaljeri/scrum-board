The rise of agile software development in recent years has created a need for automated task boards. 
Issue tracking and project management software currently facilitate agile processes such as Scrum. 
However, these full-fledged systems lack the versatility of a paper task board. They often limit user 
rights and offer overly complex workflows. This can result in suboptimal work processes or unnecessary 
frustrations in teams.

As a developer working in Scrum teams, I have seen many paper and digital task boards but all of them 
have too much limitations. Always I thought: “it shouldn’t be that difficult”. My colleagues stood behind 
me when I did took on the challenge to create, what I describe as, an analogue digital Scrum board named 
Scrummie.

This is a task board with the freedom of a paper version and is not limited with complex workflows. Of 
course, it is a digitial web service so people can use it everywhoere. For example when working from home 
or at locations within your organisation away from where the Scrum team is housed.

The team I am currently working in has helped out with interaction design, user interface, feature requests, 
project exposure and, very importantly, using it. This has been valuable feedback in terms of user testing. 
However, in order to stabilise the development process that newly added functionality does not break existing 
functionality, Scrummie needs amogst other things addition of a lot of unit tests. To make it more robust in 
usage its needs input validation. For customisation purposes the configuration needs to be extended to easily 
apply branding or colour schemes.

Scrummie is distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 3. You can download and use it for free. 

Donate now to stabilise the development process and add functionality resulting in release of version 1.0 of Scrummie
